# UofT Major Resource Map (INF481 Simulation)

This is an interactive web application that simulates a campus resource map for the University of Toronto's St. George campus. The project allows students to select their major and view a customized interactive map that highlights labs, research centres, student clubs, and more based on their major and minor studies. Please note that this project was developed as part of the INF481 final project by Tianen (Evan) Hao, a simulation for academic purposes, and it is not connected to actual University systems.

## Overview

The UTSG Major Resource Map allows students to:
- Choose from 15 majors via a modern, card-based "Select Major" page that has been entirely redesigned for improved user experience.
- Each major displays simulated resources across six categories: Academic Facilities, Research Centers, Student Clubs, Career & Networking, Social & Cultural, and Advising & Support.
- Powered by Leaflet.js, the map displays campus boundaries and resource markers at realistic positions within U of T buildings, including an interactive legend.
- Users can simulate booking resources via a reservation module, review their bookings in a dedicated "My Reservations" page, and view quick statistics.
- A new Campus Life section aggregates events, clubs, and other extracurricular activities, differentiating between academic and non-academic resources.
- A functional sign-in modal simulates logging in, showing a user menu ("Karen") with options for Settings and Log Out.
- Using Tailwind CSS for styling, the design is responsive and features smooth animations and transitions across all pages.
